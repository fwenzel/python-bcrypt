python-bcrypt
=============

python-bcrypt is a pure Python implementation of the `bcrypt`_ hashing
algorithm. This is unlike `py-bcrypt`_, which is just a wrapper around the
bcrypt reference implementation written in C.

This library uses some of the Python parts of py-bcrypt, as well as Michael
Gilfix's pure python blowfish implementation.
